 Summer 2022 Computing Bootcamp - Georgia Tech SPP



##Day 1 computing bootcamp 

1. Intro to class, goals, agenda for day
    1. Prep for ARM I,II
    2. Prep for your own projects
2. Why learn scientific computing?
    1. Applications to empirical and theoretical social science
3. Good enough practices 
    1. Data management
        1. Raw and intermediate data
        2. Documentation of preprocessing
        3. Output into plug and play data â€” i.e. easy to analyze
    2. Software
        1. Comment!
        2. Decompose into functions and refactor 
        3. Naming things
        4. Unit tests
    3. Collaboration
        1. To do lists
        2. Decide on how to communicate with collaborators
    4. Project organization
        1. Organize projects into directories
            1. Split different parts of the work in different subdirectories
                1. e.g. src, doc
                2. Name to reflect content/functions
    5. Keeping track of changes
        1. Back up everything asap.  ( and create helper functions to do so)
        2. Small changes, frequent updates
        3. Use local git + GitHub to track changes.  GitHub desktop is very user friendly
    6. Manuscripts
        1. Recommend latex + bibtex for writing, change tracking and reference management

    2. Installing packages
2. Introduction to R syntax

Questions
* What data types are available in R?
